* Suffix array searching

This repo contains two crates, one to speed up binary search in sorted integer
arrays, and one to speed up suffix array searching.  For now, this is a research
project. Code is not directly intended to be used as-is as a dependency in other
projects, and documentation is sub-par for that purpose.

** =static-search-tree=: 40x faster binary search

This is explained in detail in my [[https://curiouscoding.nl/posts/static-search-tree/][blog post]].

It provides a data structure that can answer 'binary search' queries much
faster, at the cost of 6% space overhead: given a list of =n= sorted integers
and a list of queries, it returns for each query the first number that is at
least the queried value.

It is on my to-do list, but with low priority, to make this into a nice
standalone crate.

To reproduce experiments and plots, first =cd static-search-tree=, and create
the =results= and =plots= directories (the scripts expect them to exist).
1. Run the experiments: =cargo run -r --bin bench -- --release=.

   See =cargo run -r --bin bench -- --help= for more options.
2. To generate plots: =python3 ./plot.py=. This will error at some
   point that =results-human-release.json= isn't found. To avoid that, comment
   out the last =plot_blog()= call.

** =suffix-array-searching=: Searching suffix arrays using static search trees

This is mostly placeholder code and some rough experiments. I may or may not get
back to this.
